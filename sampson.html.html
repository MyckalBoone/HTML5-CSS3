               Scott Sampson</h2>
                
                <p>What's 75 million years old and brand spanking new? A teenage       Utahceratops! Come to the 
                    Saroyan, armed with your best dinosaur roar, when Scott Sampson, Research Curator at the 
                    Utah Museum of Natural History, steps to the podium. Sampson's research has focused on the 
                    ecology and evolution of late Cretaceous dinosaurs and he has conducted fieldwork in a number 
                    of countries in Africa.

                    Scott Sampson is a Canadian-born paleontologist who received his Ph.D. in zoology from the 
                    University of Toronto. His doctoral work focused on two new species of ceratopsids, or horned 
                    dinosaurs, from the Late Cretaceous of Montana, as well as the growth and function of certopsid 
                    horns and frills.

                    Following graduation in 1993, Sampson spent a year working at the American Museum of Natural 
                    History in New York City, followed by five years as assistant professor of anatomy at the New 
                    York College of Osteopathic Medicine on Long Island. He arrived at the University of Utah 
                    accepting a dual position as assistant professor in the Department of Geology and Geophysics 
                    and curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Utah Museum of Natural History. His research 
                    interests largely revolve around the phylogenetics, functional morphology, and evolution of 
                    Late Cretaceous dinosaurs.

                    In addition to his museum and laboratory-based studies, Sampson has conducted paleontological 
                    work in Zimbabwe, South Africa, and Madagascar, as well as the United States and Canada. He was 
                    also the on-air host for the Discovery Channel's Dinosaur Planet and recently completed a book, 
                    Dinosaur Odyssey: Fossil Threads in the Web of Life, which is one of the most 
                    comprehensive surveys of dinosaurs and their worlds to date.
